            <p>The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.
      
                  Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.
                  
                  Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
                  
                  The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car.
                  
                  North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.
                  
                  The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).

                  Are you interested of visiting Djupvik by boat? The 24 hour rate is 150 sek including key to the service house and a 20 sek fee to the two showers. A connection to the electricity is an additional 50 sek / 24 hour.
